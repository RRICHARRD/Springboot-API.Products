This is an API Rest using H2 memory data base to save informations. It has get, post, delete and put mappings to realize the process of create, read, updade and delete.  

I have used Postman to simule requests and sends of this API rest. You can se all things I made using this application below:

# üëÅ‚Äçüó® Swagger-ui
We don't need to use postman all times we want to use api to test, with swagger this can be do in browser.

## :zap: Running application
To run the application requires a download of fat jar file in API-rest directory, just download the fat jar and run in machine by typing the code below in yout command prompt.

`$ java -jar API-Rest.jar`

:warning: Navigate to :file_folder: that you saved API-Rest.jar download firstly.

After run the jar file, you can enter in your browser and drag and drop this url http://127.0.0.1:8080/swagger-ui.html at url field, or just click it, after that you can test the API by using swagger interface, its easy and fast to do it. 

ü§ùüèΩ Thank you to show this post until here and test my application.
